mkdir terraform-project
cd terraform-project
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Create Terraform Configuration Files**
Inside the project directory, create the following essential files:

- `terraform.tf`: Specifies the AWS provider configuration
- `main.tf`: Defines the EC2 instance configurations
- `variable.tf`: Stores variable definitions for the project
- `output.tf`: Specifies the output values, such as instance IPs

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize Terraform**
Run the following command to initialize Terraform:
```bash
terraform init
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Plan the Infrastructure**
Check the execution plan before applying changes:
